    "Hi Sir,\n",
    "Thank you very much for your email.\n",
    "Firstly, pricing of this kind of thing is a tricky stuff. People out in industry might use different models to price. People usually get it wrong. It's not unnormal all our competitor are wrong. If we are the only one who gets this right, we will lose some clients in the short term definitely.\n",
    "If our price is uncompetitive(higher than the market), we can then just go to the market to long our competitors deals. If it turns out we are right, we would be able to arbitrage here, reverse we will lose and win nothing. This is how the results would be if we stick to our claims. Either arbitrage to make some money or lose nothing but a couple of deals.\n",
    "If we follow our competitor(market) price and they turns out to be right, of course we lose nothing but also win nothing, because everyone out there is doing the same thing, no more extra profit but we may or may not lose the deals. Since we are following the market price, its hard to say about the deals, the clients might choose different firms to get the deals because we have the same price anyway. HOWEVER, what if we are originally right in this case. The difference between market price and our price might be a certain percent of the deal's price, let's say 10%, when the market goes right, we will lose 10% of our capital invested in this kind of deals. So if we change to be the market price, the result would either win/lose nothing or lose 10% of our capital.\n",
    "Sir, it's your call now. Please feel free to take it to the next level. We are glad and open to have deeper discussion with other people.\n",
